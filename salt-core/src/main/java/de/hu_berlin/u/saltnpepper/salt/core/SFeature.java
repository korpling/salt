/**
 * <p>
 * An object of class {@link SFeature} is a label and can be added
 * like every other label to a node, relation, graph, layer or to another label.
 * Like every label a {@link SFeature} object consists of the main
 * fields {@link Label#getNamespace()}, {@link Label#getName()} and
 * {@link Label#getValue()}.
 * </p><p>
 * A {@link SFeature} could be used, to
 * add some information to any Salt object during a processing. So for instance
 * you can store any state like 'already processed' or other non-linguistic and
 * non meta annotations like 'having the color red' to it.
 * </p>
 * For further information on labels, 
 * @see Label
