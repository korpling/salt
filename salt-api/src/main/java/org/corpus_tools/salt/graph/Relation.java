/**
 * In graph theory an relation is a relation between two nodes, often an
 * relation is realized as a pair of nodes.
 * 
 * This interface defines a directed and labeled relation. A directed relation
 * is a not symmetric relation. For instance if an relation relates a node
 * <i>a</i> with a node <i>b</i>, it is not the case for the way around. A
 * labeled relation is an relation, which can contain labels as defined in
 * {@link Label}. An relation always belong to 0..1 {@link Graph}s and can also
 * be contained in one or more {@link Layer} s.
