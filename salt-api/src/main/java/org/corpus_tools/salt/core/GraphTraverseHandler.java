/**
 * The interface of a callback handler for traversing a {@link Graph} object.
 * When invoking the method
 * {@link Graph#traverse(org.eclipse.emf.common.util.EList, GRAPH_TRAVERSE_TYPE, String, GraphTraverseHandler)}
 * an object implementing this interface must be passed. This interface contains
 * three methods
 * {@link #checkConstraint(GRAPH_TRAVERSE_TYPE, String, Relation, Node, long)},
 * {@link #nodeReached(GRAPH_TRAVERSE_TYPE, String, Node, Relation, Node, long)}
 * and
 * {@link #nodeLeft(GRAPH_TRAVERSE_TYPE, String, Node, Relation, Node, long)}.
 * If the traversal reaches a new {@link Node} object being contained in the
 * {@link Graph} object, the method
 * {@link #checkConstraint(GRAPH_TRAVERSE_TYPE, String, Relation, Node, long)}
 * will be invoked. If this method returns true, it means that this node and
 * eventually its sub-graph will also be traversed. When true is returned, the
 * method
 * {@link #nodeReached(GRAPH_TRAVERSE_TYPE, String, Node, Relation, Node, long)}
 * will be invoked, when reaching the node and
 * {@link #nodeLeft(GRAPH_TRAVERSE_TYPE, String, Node, Relation, Node, long)}
 * when leaving the node.
