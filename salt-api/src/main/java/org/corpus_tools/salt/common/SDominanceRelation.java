/**
 * The meaning of the type {@link SDominanceRelation} is a part-of relation. In
 * contrast to the {@link SSpan} and the {@link SSpanningRelation}, a
 * {@link SStructure} is not just a placeholder for a bunch of {@link SToken}
 * objects, it is a proper element itself. The same goes for
 * {@link SDominanceRelation} objects. For instance, in many cases it makes a
 * linguistic difference whether tokens t1 , t2 and t3 are directly dominated by
 * a structure s1 or whether t1 and t2 are dominated by a structure s2 which is,
 * together with t3 , dominated by structure s2.
