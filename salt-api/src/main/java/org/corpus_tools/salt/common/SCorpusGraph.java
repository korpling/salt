/**
 * In Salt it is possible to create a treelike corpus structure to create
 * hierarchies between corpora. A hierarchie means that one corpus can contain
 * other corpora. The contained corpora are called subcorpora for the containing
 * corpus and the containing corpus is the super corpus of the contained ones.
 * If a corpus does not have a super corpus it is called the root corpus, if a
 * corpus does not have sub corpora it is called a leaf corpus.<br/>
 * In Salt such a treelike structure is represented by an object of type
 * {@link SCorpusGraph}. A corpus is represented by an object of type
 * {@link SCorpus} and can be added to a {@link SCorpusGraph} object. To create
 * a hierarchical relation between to corpora we used the object
 * {@link SCorpusRelation} to connect to objects of type {@link SCorpus}, where
 * the super corpus is the source of that relation and the sub corpus is the
 * target of that relation. A corpus can have an unbound number of sub corpora.
 * To create such an relation in the {@link SCorpusGraph}, you first have to add
 * the super corpus (for instance by calling
 * {@link SCorpusGraph#addSNode(SNode)}) and second you can add the sub corpus
 * by calling {@link SCorpusGraph#addSSubCorpus(SCorpus, SCorpus)}. This will
 * automatically create the relation between both corpora and returns a pointer
 * to the relation. Another way to do this is to add both corpora by calling
 * {@link SCorpusGraph#addSSubCorpus(SCorpus, SCorpus)}, creating a relation of
 * type {@link SCorpusRelation}, setting its source to the super corpus, setting
 * its target to the sub corpus and adding the relation to the
 * {@link SCorpusGraph} object by calling
 * {@link SCorpusGraph#addSRelation(SRelation)} . But note, that first the
 * second way contains more handwork and second it is recommended to use the
 * first appoach, because the {@link SElementId} object belonging to the sub
 * corpus can only represent the hierarchy, when the {@link SCorpusGraph} knows
 * about it, when adding the sub corpus. </br>
 * The 'real' linguistic data containing primary data, tokens, structures,
 * annotations and so on are contained in lets say a container-object called
 * document. Such a document is represented by the type {@link SDocument}. A
 * document always belongs to a corpus (if this corpus is a super or a sub
 * corpus makes no difference). Parallel to a corpus, a document is a
 * specialization of a node (in Salt of type {@link SNode}) as well. Such a
 * containment between a corpus and a document is represented by the type
 * {@link SCorpusDocumentRelation}, where the source of this relation is the
 * corpus and the target of this relation is the document. To add such a
 * {@link SDocument} object to the {@link SCorpusGraph} use the method
 * {@link SCorpusGraph#addDocument(SCorpus, SDocument)}. This method will
 * automatically create the relation between them. Like with adding a sub
 * corpus, here you can also do this by hand hand, but note that even here it is
 * recommended using the method
 * {@link SCorpusGraph#addDocument(SCorpus, SDocument)} because of the
 * {@link SElementId} object belonging to the {@link SDocument} object.</br>
 * In Salt the 'real' linguistic data are also stored in a graph called
 * document-graph which is represented by the type {@link SDocumentGraph}. An
 * object of this type is contained in a {@link SDocument} object and can be set
 * and get by calling {@link SDocument#setDocumentGraph(SDocumentGraph)} and
 * {@link SDocument#getDocumentGraph()}. A closer documentation of a document
 * graph, you can find in {@link SDocumentGraph}.
