 * in this version. Meso- and endoclitics are not yet supported.
 * <p>
 * The {@link String} representation of the respective clitics
 * needs to be a regular expression, as it will be used to 
 * {@link Pattern#compile(String)} a pattern to split the 
 * {@link STextualDS}'s text, i.e., as below.

 * <code>
 * Pattern.compile("^"  XClitic  "(.)$")

 * Two examples for such a regex string are (<b>note the main group!</b>):
 * <ul>
 * <li>Enclitics for English: <code>"('(s|re|ve|d|m|em|ll)|n't)"</code></li>
 * <li>Proclitics for French: <code>"([dcjlmnstDCJLNMST]'|[Qq]u'|[Jj]usqu'|[Ll]orsqu')"</code></li>
