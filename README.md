#Salt

* **language-independent** <br/>
Salt supports a huge set of languages and typesets. Each language which can be expressed in UTF-8 is supported by Salt.

* **theory-neutral** <br/>
Salt is open to any linguistic school or theory, not limited to a specific one.

* **tagset independent** <br/>
Salt is not bound to a tagset. Annotations are represented as attribute-value pairs and can be chosen freely.

* **open source** <br/>
Salt is licensed under the Apache License, Version 2.0 and published on Github.

* **multimedia support** <br/>
Salt is a text-based model, but also supports the modeling of audio and video corpora.

* **annotation layer independent** <br/>
Salt is not limited to a specific set of annotation layers. Since Salt is a graph-based model, you can model many different structures, such as tree structures, span annotations, coreference chains and so on.
