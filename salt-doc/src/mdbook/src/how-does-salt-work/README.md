# How does Salt work?

This section addresses the single components of Salt and the linguistic
aspects they are covering. It is divided into two parts, the
corpus-structure and the document-structure. The corpus-structure is a
grouping mechanism, to organize a corpus, whereas the document-structure
covers the \'real\' linguistic part.
